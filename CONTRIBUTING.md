### Issues

- There will be PLENTY of issues for you to choose from. If you see one that fits you, comment on it to be assigned to it.

- Please be aware that we will all be waiting on your piece of work. The easiest way to get CONFLICTS is by delivering outdated/late work.

- Be respectful and deliver within 24 hrs. Those issues will be short enough for that to be accomplished very easily.

- If you run into problems, DO comment on your task. Other people and myself will gladly give a hand.

- I intend to open GITHUB PROJECTS for this app. To be announced in the near future. For now, well organized issues will do the job.
