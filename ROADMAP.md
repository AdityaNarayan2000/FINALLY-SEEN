# HELLO COLLABS!

> Thanks for participating and I trully hope this project is adding to your contributions.

## THE GOAL:

The objective of this project is to have it 100% build by cotribution. Some tasks may seen too small or simple. Trust me, I remember how it was to NOT know how to contribute and based on that, my intention is to welcome ALL levels of collaborators.

The project is a MERN application which will render links to developers portfolio. It will also display a featured picture of such portfolio and give registered users the ability to vote up.

### Where are we?

- Client:

  - [x] When I access the application URL I see the "home" page.
  - [x] The home page has a header
  - [ ] The header has a Logo, and a Nav bar with options to Login or Register
  - [ ] The Nav will display icons if viewport less than 798px
  - [x] The home page also has a footer
  - [ ] The home page has its main content wrapped in a Wrapper component
  - [ ] The "home" page seen at first by any user will display the top 10 portfolios based on upvotes.
  - [ ] When I click Login, a login form takes over the content inside the Wrapper
  - [ ] When I click Register, a Register form takes over the content inside the Wrapper
  - [ ] Initially, when I submit login/register, a simple state will change, which will display a nav with different content: Top, Latest, add(icon), Logout

  > Attention: This is the first plan and may change at any time. The intention is to give as many contribution opportunities as possible. As the project evolves, such features will become more advance and likely to change.

  ### SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

  - We only move forward as we accomplish the roadmap

  - We will work on a particular feature as an epic, and move forward when that Epic is completed to achieve MVP.

  - There's absolutely no rush, and mistakes are WELCOME as we all learn from them

  - HAVE FUN!
